# test-script
Computer Science Project Test Script. The project was to build a compiler in c for a made up programming language 'alan'. Some alan files can be found in the test cases. This script runs different tests to see if the compiler is functioning properly.

## What I Learned
- Bash scripting
- Setting up automated tests
- Programming in c
- How a compiler works
