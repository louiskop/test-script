# Test script for project part I

### Instructions:
1. Put the file in your bin folder (*/alan/bin/test-script/)
2. Run with bash main.sh

### Tests (and adding your own):
- Tests are pairs of two files in */test-script/tests/
- In format *.alan with corresponding output files to tests against *.out
	- NOTE: The .alan file and the .out file MUST have the same name
- Add your own tests and commit to the repo

### Contributions
Please add and improve to the script
I did not have enough time to write a short script, so I wrote a long one
instead.
